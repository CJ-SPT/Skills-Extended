# Books

The design philosophy behind books is to implement a feature to allow the player to provide boosts to skill buffs for limited or permanant durations. This lays the foundation for using this feature for different purposes down the road, much like the custom quest mechanic.

## Considerations
- Time bonuses on books should apply even while not in raid
- Buffs should be created, stored, then disposed of after a certain period of time has passed.

## Implemented Books

### Lockpicking Volume 1

- Provides a 30 minute duration book to lockpicking
